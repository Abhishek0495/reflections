How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

by seeing the difference between the character

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

 we can check the earlier command or data we have write and correct our bug if any. 
 we can compare our codes.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

  pros we can save the changes after some real work is done or any changes in the document
  cons sometime we forget to save the file data is lost .  

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

  we can access our data more efficiently and change the data accurately.  

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log command helps us to know the changes we make in file by the time it changes 
    git diff command helps us to know the differne in code we make between two codes

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

  we can now exact where the error is occured and we comper the code with the previous one to know the diff between the code  

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
